        <!-- Name of Function                       	Description
____________________________________________________________________________________________________        
        hasOwnProperty()	               Method that returns a boolean indicating whether the object has the specified property as its own property.
        Object.isExtensible()	           static method determines if an object is extensible (whether it can have new properties added to it).
        Object.freeze()	                   This object can’t be changed, new properties cannot be added, existing properties cannot be removed.
        Object.hasOwn()	                   static method returns true if the specified property is a direct property of the object — even if the property value is null or undefined. false if the property is inherited, or does not exist, the method returns false.
        Object.is()	                       Static method determines whether two values are the same value or not.
        Object.seal()	                   static method seals an object. Sealing an object prevents extension and makes existing properties non-configurable. A sealed object has a fixed set of properties: new properties cannot be added, existing properties cannot be removed, their enumerability and configurability cannot be changed, and its prototype cannot be re-assigned.
        Object.prototype.tolocalestring()  Number method that is used to convert a number into a locale-specific numeric representation of the number and return its value as a string.
        object.prototype.valueOf()	       Method of object converts the this value to an object.
        Object.create()	                   Static method creates a new object, using an existing object as the prototype of the newly created object.
        Object.defineProperties()	       static method defines new or modifies existing properties directly on an object, returning the object. -->
